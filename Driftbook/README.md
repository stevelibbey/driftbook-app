# Driftbook

##Stories in motion. Images in rhythm. Memory as performance.

Driftbook is a creative tool for writers, artists, and performers who work in both word and image. It transforms sequences of text and visuals into living, breathing compositions—part film, part poem, part dream.

Each “drift” is a cinematic thread of your imagination: fragments of writing, sound, and imagery that flow together in real time. Whether you’re storyboarding a novel, building a gallery piece, or performing live, Driftbook captures the pulse between stillness and movement.

Born from the same bones as SoggyBones, Driftbook is its visual twin — a tool for narrative as experience, not artifact.
A place where stories don’t just sit on the page — they move through it.
